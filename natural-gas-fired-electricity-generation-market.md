<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Natural Gas-Fired Electricity Generation Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>CCGT</li><li>OCGT</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Natural gas-fired electricity generation comprises two primary market types: Combined Cycle Gas Turbines (CCGT) and Open Cycle Gas Turbines (OCGT). CCGT systems utilize both a gas and a steam turbine to efficiently generate electricity, capturing waste heat for additional power production, making them suitable for baseload and peak demands. In contrast, OCGT plants operate with a simpler design, generating electricity quickly during peak load periods but with lower efficiency, often serving as a backup to meet sudden demand spikes.</p></p>
