<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Ventilation Fan Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Axial</li><li>Centrifugal</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal ventilation fan market is categorized into two primary types: axial and centrifugal fans. Axial fans move air parallel to the axis of the fan, offering efficient airflow for cooling and ventilation in various industrial applications. They are typically used in spaces requiring high volume and low pressure. Centrifugal fans, on the other hand, draw air into the fan and then discharge it at a right angle, generating higher pressure, making them ideal for applications requiring substantial air movement against resistance.</p></p>
